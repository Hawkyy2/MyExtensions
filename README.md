# Web Extensions
This repo contains all the Firefox Add-ons built using Javascript API. It also has the same code base which can be made to run in chrome. This is a series of experiements which is developed for showcasing the WebExtension API usage.

I am trying to share the source code and the respective explanation of the code flow is based on Firefox Add-on. There wont be much difference between Chrome code and Firefox Code.
